atmoflux.constants
=================
Provides physical and derived constants used across the package.
Includes psychrometric constants, molecular ratios, latent heats, radiative and
turbulent-transfer constants, and aerosol microphysical parameters. All
pressures and vapor pressures in atmoflux are expressed in kilopascals (kPa).
